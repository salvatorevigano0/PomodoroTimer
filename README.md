# PomodoroTimer
## Introduction
The Pomodoro Technique is a popular time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It is a way to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This simple Python script, called `pomodoro_timer`, allows you to automate your Pomodoro Technique. Simply input the duration of the Pomodoro cycle (working time), the duration of the short break, and the number of cycles you want to complete, and the script will keep track of your intervals and breaks.

## Features
- Easy to use with a simple user interface.
- Customizable to fit your working style with customizable durations for the Pomodoro cycle and short breaks.
- Print-out of the total number of minutes worked, total number of minutes on break, and the total number of minutes for the Pomodoro Technique.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the Python script from the [GitHub repository]([https://github.com/openai/gpt-3.5-py](https://github.com/salvatorevigano0/PomodoroTimer)).
2. Open the script in your favorite Python editor.
